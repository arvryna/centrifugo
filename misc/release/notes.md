Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server in a language-agnostic way. It can be a missing piece in your application infrastructure for introducing real-time features. Think chats, live comments, multiplayer games, streaming metrics â€“ you'll be able to build amazing web and mobile real-time apps with a help of Centrifugo. Choose the approach you like:

* bidirectional communication over WebSocket or SockJS
* or unidirectional communication over WebSocket, EventSource (Server-Sent Events), HTTP-streaming, GRPC
* or... combine both!
